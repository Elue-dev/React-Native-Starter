# React Native Starter Template

This template is designed to make it easier to bootstrap a react native project configured with Expo and Typescript. It also provides some common dependencies you would need. If there are dependencies that are present that ypu don't need simply run the following command:

```bash
npm uninstall dependency-name
```

## What comes with this starter

- Expo
- TypeScript
- Navigations (also with Tab Navigations). Types for this are also defined in the [`navigation.ts` file in the types folder](types/navigation.ts).

- Nativewind / Tailwind. Ofcourse, you can decide to use the StyleSheet API and completely remove tailwind. (remember to remove the `app.d.ts` if you are removing tailwind from the project).
- SVG Support. You can use SVGs in your app to replace pngs in certain parts of your app. It utilizes the `react-native-svg-transformer` library.

## Clone this project
