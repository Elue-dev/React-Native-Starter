# React Ntive Starter Template
This template is designed to make it easier to bootstrap a react native project configured with Expo and Typescript. It also provides some common dependencies you would need. If there are dependencies that are present that ypu don't need simply run ```
npm uninstall dependency-name```.

## What comes with this starter
- Expo
- TypeScript
- Navigations (also with Tab Navigations). Types for this are also available.
- Nativewind / Tailwind. Ofcourse, you can decide to use the StyleSheet API and completely remove tailwind. (remember to remove the ```app.d.ts``` if you are removing tailwind from the project).
- SVG Support. You can use SVGs in your app to replace pngs in certain parts of your app. It utilizes the ```react-native-svg-transformer``` library.
